# Video Info Application Project
This is my code based off the video info project on Udemy's 'Electron for Desktop Applications' course 

## Prerequisites
1. Install npm

<hr>

## - Running the Application
To run the desktop application, use the following command in the project directory
```bash
npm run electron
```
<hr>

## Video Info Application
The files in this repository reflect the use of electron and the communication methods explained in the electron_notes.md file to create a GUI application that returns the duration of a video file using the fluent-ffmpeg npm package.

## Stopping the script
To stop the application just use 'Ctrl + C' in the terminal running the application, or clicking the 'X' button on the application GUI, or going to File -> Quit on the application GUI.
